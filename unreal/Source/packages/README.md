# For SQLite3 (Works in UE5.2)
Works even if it is not added to this projects linker (.lib files). Why??? <br />
Do not question and especially do not touch it. <br />
Also for compatibility issues do NOT remove the SQL Database Support plugins from this projects Build.cs Public Dependency Module Names array. <br />

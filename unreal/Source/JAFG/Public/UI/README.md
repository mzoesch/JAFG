# HUD vs OSD

HUD and OSD are two different concepts in the context of UI design.
HUD stands for Head-Up Display, and OSD stands for On-Screen Display.
Both are used to display information to the user, but they are used in different ways.

In this game, we use HUDs to display information onto a transparent surface,
such as the hotbar, debug screen, etc.
We use OSDs to display information on top of the main content on the screen,
such as the various containers, tooltips, menus, etc.

# JAFG

Game made with UE5 (5.3.X).

#### Engine

Please note that this game uses a custom engine build with modifications to Epics source code. A fork of the engine is available on my [github](https://github.com/mzoesch/ue-rel) and it will require access to Epics private repos.

Engine modifications are only used to provide better DX and is not required to run the editor version of the game.

More information [here](uengine/StagedSourceModifications.md).
